## Advanced Linear Algebra: PCA Implementation and Matrix Analysis

This repository contains an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch. The project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: PCA

- Complete implementation of PCA algorithm from scratch
- Analysis of fuel economy dataset
- Dynamic selection of principal components
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Part 2: Matrix Eigenvalue calculation

- Analysis of a 3x3 matrix
- Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Determination of eigenvalue importance in percentage form
- Collaborative work documented on Miro whiteboard

### Key Features

- PCA implementation from scratch using NumPy
- Covariance matrix computation
- Eigendecomposition
- Data projection onto principal components
- Variance preservation analysis
- Detailed matrix analysis with eigenvalue calculations

### Usage

- Open the Google Colab notebook
- Upload the provided dataset
- Execute cells sequentially
- Review outputs and visualizations
